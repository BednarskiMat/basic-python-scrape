Two simple web scrapers in python

scrape.py - followed tutorial to get top 50 imdb movies 

scrape2.py - solo attempt at a scrape using knowledge from tutorial. Found a different site that was meant for practice scraping to use. Turned the scraping process into a usable function that is used in testing.py
